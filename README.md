# wp4-queries
Repository for researcher-provided SPARQL queries on Linked structured data.

Due to the success of [grlc](http://grlc.io) and 'wp4-queries' we have decided to create multiple dedicated gits. Currently the list consits of:
* [wp4-queries-hisco](https://github.com/CLARIAH/wp4-queries-hisco)
* [wp4-queries-cenus-micro](https://github.com/CLARIAH/wp4-queries-census-micro)
* [wp4-queries-hsn](https://github.com/CLARIAH/wp4-queries-hsn)
