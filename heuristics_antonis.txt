• H1: Minimise optional graph patterns: Reduce the number of optional triple patterns by identifying those triple patterns for a given query that will always be bound using dataset statistics.• H2: Use named graphs to localise SPARQL sub-graph patterns: Use named graphs to specify the subset of triples in a dataset that portions of a query should be evaluated against.• H3: Reduce intermediate results: Use sequence paths to replace connected triple patterns where the object of one triple pattern is the subject of another.• H4: Reduce the effects of cartesian products: Use aggregates to reduce the size of solution sequences.• H5: Specifying alternative URIs: Consider different ways of specifying alternative URIs beyond UNION.Additional tip: VALUE to top; works sometimes
